🧠 About Me

  ⚡ I’m **Vaibhav Verma** — a 15-year-old innovator, founder of **Inscipe**, and creative technologist pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
  💻 Passionate about **AI, development, hardware, and storytelling**, I blend cutting-edge tech with imaginative narratives to create solutions that feel like they're from another dimension.
  📕 Author of *Arjun’s Journey*, a motivational tale of growth, resilience, and overcoming the unknown.
  🧠 Exploring the intersection of **creativity, code, and consciousness**, I build AI models that understand emotions, automate complex tasks, and bring intelligence to everyday devices.
  🌟 As a young entrepreneur, I've founded Inscipe, an AI-powered e-commerce platform revolutionizing how we shop and innovate. From hacking hardware like Raspberry Pi to crafting web apps with Next.js, I'm always experimenting in my "Upside Down" lab.
  🎮 When not coding, I'm gaming, creating YouTube content, or dreaming up the next big thing. My goal? To make AI accessible to everyone, even on feature phones, and inspire the next generation of creators.
